# teller
A **game engine**, a **live editor** and a **debugging environment** (IDE) for browser based text adventure games.

The documentation is in [teller.wiki](https://github.com/gauchedroite/teller.wiki) project.

The games themselves live in their own projects. For example, *Billy* is in [game-billy](https://github.com/gauchedroite/game-billy).
