# teller
A **game engine**, a **live editor** and a **debugging environment** (IDE) for browser based text adventure games.

## Related projects
The documentation for the engine is in the [wiki](https://github.com/gauchedroite/teller/wiki).

Each games has its own project to store their assets. For example, all assets for *Billy* are in [tellergame-billy](https://github.com/gauchedroite/tellergame-billy).

The games can be played here in [teller](https://github.com/gauchedroite/teller). They're just uninteresting tests though.

## Notes
Do not forget to `npm run live` after changing files. This will update the live site.
